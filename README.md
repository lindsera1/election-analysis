# Election Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Seth, has asked me to analyze the votes in three Colorado counties to determine several outcomes.
1. The total votes cast in the election
2. List out the candidates in the election that received votes
3. Calculate each candidates total votes and the percentage out of the election total
4. See who the winner was by popular vote

I used the Python programming language to collect and filter all the necessary data to get these results.

## Resources

Include:

- Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio Code 1.49.0
- Data Resource: election_results.csv

## Results Summary

After our analysis, the results were as follows:

- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election

The candidates names and results:
